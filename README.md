# Description
The purpose of the project entitled as “HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM” is to computerize the Front Office Management of Hospital to develop software which is user friendly, simple, fast, and cost – effective. It deals with the collection of patient’s information, diagnosis details, etc. Traditionally, it was done manually.
The main function of the system is to register and store patient details and doctor
details and retrieve these details as and when required, and also to manipulate these details meaningfully System input contains patient details, diagnosis details; while system output is to get these details on to the CRT screen.
            Our project Hospital Management system includes registration of patients, storing their details into the system, and also computerized billing in the pharmacy, and labs. Our software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details of every patient and the staff automatically. It includes a search facility to know the current status of each room. User can search availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id.
